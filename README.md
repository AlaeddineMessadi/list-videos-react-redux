### Notes

- The backend can be accessed via http://localhost:3001
- It runs with a package called **_json-server_**, and the data comes from the **_db.json_** file
- The JSON structure of the **_db.json_** file was twisted a bit on purpose. Please do not change the original DB structure. Of course, on the front-end side you are free to transform and manipulate the data in any way you feel appropriate
- Material-UI was added to the starter template. If you feel more comforable with another UI framework, you can change it. You can add all the styles that you need

> #### TODO
>
> - more tests.
> - Style enhancements.
